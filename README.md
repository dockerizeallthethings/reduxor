# Isomorphic React

Isomorphic React starting package cause the rest of them suck and I wanted to make my own.

### Primary Goals
* Clearly defined easy to follow file structure.
* Isomorphicize as much as practical.
* Plays nicely as a 12 Factor app. http://12factor.net/
* Avoid unnecessary dependencies. _(ie. no gulp)_ 
* Simple basic deployment script to SSH into a server and run a git pull.
* Must be low volume production ready launchable via npm start for upstart.
* ES2015 as much as possible

### Future goals
* Unit tests
* Feature tests
