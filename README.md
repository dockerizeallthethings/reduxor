Isomorphic React starting package cause the rest of them suck and I wanted to make my own. 

### Primary Goals
* Clearly defined easy to follow file structure.
* Isomorphicize as much as practical.
* Plays nicely as a 12 Factor app. http://12factor.net/
* Avoid unnecessary dependencies.
* Simple basic deployment script to SSH into a server and run a git pull.
* ES2015
* Webpack
* Alt Flux

### Future goals
* Unit tests
* Feature tests
